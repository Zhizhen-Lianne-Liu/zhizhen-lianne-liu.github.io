I built an interactive finance dashboard that runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly. It demonstrates real-time data analysis capabilities without requiring any server infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Try the Dashboard

**[Launch Interactive Dashboard](/finance/finance_dashboard_web.html)**

## Features

- **Interactive Stock Analysis** - Enter stock symbols and visualize price movements
- **Performance Metrics** - Calculate returns, volatility, and trading ranges
- **Market Overview** - S&P 500 index analysis with trend visualization
- **Reactive Interface** - All components update automatically based on your selections

## Tech Stack

Built with [marimo](https://marimo.io/) (reactive Python notebooks), Altair for visualizations, and WebAssembly for browser execution. The entire analysis engine runs client-side - no external APIs or servers required.

**Demo Note**: Uses simulated financial data to demonstrate the analytical capabilities and interactive features.
